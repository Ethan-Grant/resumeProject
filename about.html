<p> Thank you for showing interest in my portfolio! Let me introduce myself.
<p> I am originally from Florida, though I have lived in Utah for almost half my life, and in Salt Lake City since 2017.
     In my free time I enjoy playing video games on the computer I built myself, researching anything that makes me curious, recording music, and making videos.
     
<p> I first started having an interest in Technology as a career in 2015. I had a roommate who showed me what code looks like and some of the basics of HTML and CSS.
    I was instantly intrigued. I started my learning on Code Academy, then more on Udemy, and finally with SLCC. I dabbled in several languages (C#, Java, PHP, HTML, CSS), but 
    finally found a sense of direction once I started working in the SLCC Web Development and Design certificate. So far I have completed the Photoshop and HTML classes, and
    look forward to learning JavaScript, PHP, and more before the program is completed in May. 
     
<p>I love thinking about what makes a program or video game work, and I am excited to keep progressing in the Computer Sciences.
